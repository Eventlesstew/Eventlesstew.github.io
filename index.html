                    A Planetballs youtube series set <i>before</i> our present day! 
                    This series is set in the Solar System in Season 1, and a completely
                    different star system in Season 2, and was inspired by ColinMapping's
                    "Alternate Future of the Solar System" series.

                    This video shows the formation of the Solar System in a similar style to Planetballs: Dawn of Sirius. 
                    The information in this video is compiled from decades of scientific research, including theories 
                    such as the Grand Tack and Nice Models.
