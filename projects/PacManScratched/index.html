            <h2>v2.8.1.1</h2>
            <p>Changed update format from STAGE.MAJOR.MINOR to STAGE.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A certain easter egg can no longer be triggered when in the middle of a game.</li>

            <h2>v2.8.1</h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to make v2.8.1 a few days after v2.8 came out, but there was wayyyy 
                too much important stuff in my way which led to this “quick” hotfix update 
                being held back, much to my annoyance.</p>
            <p>
                This hotfix adds more things to the massive refinement pile of v2.8, along with
                fixing bugs & oversights I missed and changing certain features in preparation for v2.9.
            </p>

            <h3>MENU CHANGES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Clyde Swap is now disabled when using the Atari Game Style or Punky's 
                    Revenge Gamemode, since Clyde or his replacements are not present.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cutscenes are disabled in the Atari and Pac-Mania Game Styles
                    since they do not have cutscenes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Removed the exclamation marks from settings that disable certain others,
                    will work out a better way to notify people of why certain settings are
                    disabled in v2.9.
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h3>JR PAC-MAN CUTSCENE UPDATE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The second and third cutscenes from Jr. Pac-Man have been added!</li>
                <li>Remastered versions only include reskins for now, but enhancements are yet to come.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>THREE NEW CHARACTERS</h3>
            <p>Added three new playable characters, I hope you enjoy playing as them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Car from New Rally-X.</li>
                <li>The main character of Dig Dug, Taizo Hori!</li>
                <li>Mappy from Mappy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>NEW SETTINGS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>INFINITE LIVES - 
                    You can now set Lives to be infinite, which is helpful for inexperienced players to enjoy the game
                    or simply for praciticing certain parts of the game. Using this option disables Extend Threshold,
                    since there is no point in increasing infinity by one.
                </li>
                <li>RANDOM MUSIC - 
                    Music can now be set to “Random” which randomises the music per level.
                </li>
                <li>RANDOM DOT SHAPES - 
                    Dot Shapes are no longer randomised by the Randomiser Maze, but instead
                    through their own Random setting. This means that the Randomiser Maze doesn't override this
                    setting anymore.
                </li>
                <li>INVISIBLE DOT SHAPES -
                    For Pac-Maniacs, The dot shape can also be set to Invisible, I hope memory serves you well!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>MENU CHANGES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Added Infoboxes within the Settings menu! They are distinguished through a different font,
                appear below the usual game settings and rather than changing the game in some way,
                they are purely for containing some fun information about Pac-Man Scratched.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Credits have been moved to it's own section in the settings. This includes the bottom
                    right text and the full credits from project descriptions. This gives me an easier time
                    managing everything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added a new sound for scrolling through the menu, taken from DasScheit's Pac-Man remake.
                    (Not sure where the original sound came from though)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Changed the Mazes description and Maze Workshop's preview to better indicate where the Maze Editor is.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Lives description has similarly been changed to tell the player how to exit out of a game,
                    which is useful if they set the lives to Infinite.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reworked random setting carousel. Not only does it work better, it now works for other things such as Random Chaos.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rewrote Offset Bug's description to be more clearer plus fix some typos. 
                    (The latter was the primary intention, but I did the former bc why not :D
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>EDITOR CHANGES</h3>
            <p>Reworked how lives are handled in the Editor.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When you start playing a maze, your lives are finite,
                    but they will be set to infinite when opening up the
                    editor, even when going back to playtesting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This allows lives to keep their finite nature when playing other people's mazes,
                    but when using the Editor, they will be kept infinite to prevent too many unfortunate
                    mishaps from kicking you back to the menu with your progress being lost.
                </li>
                <li>
                    “But Event, can't they just open and close the editor to get infinite lives and cheese my maze?”
                    They can also set it to infinite in the settings. >:) 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>GAMEPLAY CHANGES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>More changes have been made to Punky, but I was threatened with my game being flooded with AtBelch's propaganda if I listed them.</li>
                <li>Fully reworked Ghost movement again.</li>
                <li>Finally found a good solution to the FPS-related issues plaguing the game's speed for way too long!</li>
                <li>Removed the blue from the Tods (Atari Ghosts), Atari Pac-Man and Atari-style Miru.</li>
                <li>
                    If the lives are set to Infinite through the Settings or the Editor, the lives bar now has the infinity
                    symbol next to a single life icon to indicate this. (Based on the one from Undertale)
                </li>
                <li>The Invisible character now has a life icon, making it clearer how many lives it has.</li>
                <li>More funny sounds have been added to the Invisible character's arsenal of eat sounds.</li>
                <li>Each ghost now has a different speed value in the Mania Game Style.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Very Fast: Blinky, Punky</li>
                        <li>Fast: Pinky, Sue</li>
                        <li>Normal: Inky, Clyde, Funky</li>
                        <li>Slow: Spunky</li>
                    </ul>
                    This change generally makes the game style a bit harder, but Spunky getting a speed nerf should make her easier to deal with.
                </li>
                <li>Remaining dots no longer disappear when Pac-Man eats the fruit in Fruit Chase.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This was done to fix a bug that impacted the Editor.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>OTHER CHANGES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pressing F will now show the frames per second on the bottom right.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>BUGS FIXED</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Punky had some bugs, so they were fixed.</li>
                <li>Tim now keeps his black eyes when eaten.</li>
                <li>As stated in Gameplay changes, the FPS issues impacting the game's speed has been fixed.</li>
                <li>Fixed the Mania Ghost Siren grinding people's ears.</li>
                <li>Fixed the Atari Style Game Over screen not looking right.</li>
                <li>Fixed options still being darkened when opting out of gamemodes that override these settings.</li>
                <li>Fixed Cornering not working when moving southwest.</li>
                <li>Removed Herobrine</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>v2.7.4</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Removed three stray dots in the top right corner of Junior Jumble 2 which made the maze impossible to beat.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>v2.7.3</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>ADDED THE FIRST CUTSCENE FOR JR PAC-MAN!</li>
                <li>The remaining cutscenes and their remastered versions will come in future updates.</li>
                <li>
                    Fixed weird fruit behaviour in the Maze Workshop. (MPM Game Style) Now it works
                    under a different system that should replicate the original behaviour well.
                </li>
                <li>Fixed incorrect colours showing up in Mania Mashup.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>v2.7.2</h2>
            <p>Bug fixes, Movement optimizations and added some new parts in the Maze Editor!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Reworked the entire movement system to make it so Pac-Man doesn't wait until a full tile to turn. 
                    This should make controlling Pac-Man much better than before
                </li>
                <li>Added elements from that one Tengen maze into the Maze Editor.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>v2.7.1</h2>
            <p>Changed Maze Editor text to show how to start a new project.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>v2.7</h2>
            <p>HAPPY APRIL FOOLS!</p>
            <p>This is not the fool you're looking for, but I have other plans in mind.</p>

            <h3>BAD NEWS FIRST</h3>
            <p>
                I'm sorry mobile Scratchers, but unfortunately, I had to remove Mobile Controls.
                They were way too janky.
            </p>
            <p>With that out of the way, I suppose it's time to unveil my greatest work yet…</p>

            <h3>THE MAZE EDITOR IS BACK!!!</h3>
            <p>The Maze Editor has returned as the Maze Workshop, found in the Maze setting.</p>
            <p>
                Fun fact: There was a Maze editor in Pac-Man Scratched since the very beginning,
                which is how I managed to recreate all of the mazes you love. Now it has been
                polished for players to use as well.
            </p>

            <p>I should also mention the differences from the old, separate, bad Maze Editor project too.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>NO MORE LAG! - The Maze Editor has now been optimised to run much greater than 5 FPS.</li>
                <li>Actually useful guides - Now there's a proper UI showing you what you can do.</li>
                <li>A different way to export - Instead of remixing the project, you now just Press “T” and show off your maze to others!</li>
                <li>
                    Infinite Lives! - This should help when editing mazes by preventing Game Over's from ruining your work,
                    or if you're trying to beat someone's near-impossible Maze. Remember, you can go back to the menu by
                    clicking the Green Flag.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>NEW MUSIC!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Outward - Pac-Land Music is here!</li>
                <li>Toc Man's Lair - Fitting for a showdown with Punky or for another tough challenge.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>GAMEPLAY CHANGES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Clyde now moves randomly if you move too close to him in the Mania Game Style.</li>
                <li>Removing that one frame delay between glide blocks making everything slower than intended was proving to be very tedious, so unfortunately it's staying in...</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>INTERNAL CHANGES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reworked how Mazes are loaded by integrating them into the decompiler used for importing Custom Mazes.</li>
                <li>Properly implemented the new jumping algorithms for Pac-Man.</li>
                <li>I've also changed the code for other stuff in general.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>v2.6.3</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Speed being faster than normal has been fixed. (For real this time)</li>
                <li>Increased Menu Scroll speed from 0.2 - 0.15.</li>
                <li>Fixed selection dots being aligned wrong.</li>

                    PAC MANIA GAME STYLE - Sue and the Commons have joined the Ghost party!
                    Now you'll have to deal with them when clearing mazes.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sue and Funky will constantly chase the player.</li>
                        <li>Spunky will chase Pac-Man and scatter towards the top right
                            corner in a similar manner to Blinky, except she doesn't
                            become aggressive when there are a few dots left though.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>MENU REDESIGN</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The menu has been fully reworked! Now all of the settings are on the
                    left in one massive menu with the Maze preview and a description of
                    the selected setting on the right.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unfortunately, I removed the mouse controls and reduced the Maze preview
                    to just the Maze itself. They were a bit much of a hassle to keep.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>NEW SETTINGS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    MUSIC - You can now listen to your favourite tunes from Pac-Mania or Pac & Pal during gameplay. You can even let the maze automatically decide what mania music should be played through the “Auto” option.
                    New settings now include Music and Ability.
                </li>
                <li>ABILITY - You can now make Pac-Man jump or speed up by pressing the Spacebar.</li>
                <li>PRESET - This will automatically set everything up for you if you just want to go in and play the classics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>SETTING CHANGES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bonus Life Threshold has been renamed to Extend Threshold and now has the option to get a bonus life every 5K, 50K, 100K or 150K points.</li>
                <li>Elroy Indicator has been reworked as Aggressive Blinky for easier understanding. There is now an option to disable this mode entirely.</li>
                <li>Pinky/Inky offset bug has been renamed to just “Offset Bug” to include any future ghosts that may use an offset target tile.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>GAMEPLAY CHANGES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Frightened ghosts have slowed down. This should hopefully allow you to rack up a large chomp streak easier.</li>
                <li>If Pac-Man hasn't eaten a dot for 4 seconds, a ghost will exit the ghost house if there are any still in there.</li>
                <li>Added music for every maze.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>INTERNAL CHANGES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Separated the X and Y values to allow jumping.</li>
                <li>The Fruit is now built into the Entities Sprite and the Scatter/Chase algorithm is also built into the Tile Sprite. This means that the game now has two fewer sprites.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>And of course, there are bugfixes.</p>

        </div>

        <!--
        v1.9
NEW MAZE: Junior Jumble
Now you can play through all 7 mazes with no scrolling needed.
NOTE: Due to size limits, the sides of the maze cannot be fully shown atm, but a temporary fix is to use Turbowarp.

NEW OPTION: Dot Shape
You can now have your dots shaped like Hearts or Wafers. The original dots are still there of course.
(Please note that this doesn’t appear in the Maze Preview)

- Watcher’s Way has gotten a full visual makeover.
- Rearranged the settings in the main menu. Game Styles has been moved there and the Character and Gamemode options have swapped places.
- Pac-Man’s speed has been reworked. He no longer gets a minor speed boost (noticeable in the Fast mode) when he eats a Power Pellet.
- Corrected the score values from Ghosts in the Atari Game Style.
- Vitamins give 100 points instead of 10 points and now show the score value in the Atari Game Style.
- The Ghost House Entry is now coloured to the fill colour in mazes but defaults to pink if there is no fill. This affects Ms. Pac’s Quadrants, Atari Alleyways and Junior Jumble.

- As always, bugfixes lol
- Fixed the Score and High Score counters being half a tile above the maze instead of 1 tile higher.
- Frightened and Eaten ghosts can turn in the areas where they’re not supposed to in Pac-Man’s Park.
- Fixed a bug causing Ghost behaviours to not work correctly.

v1.8.1
Fixed an issue related to Scatter and Chase behaviours not working correctly.

v1.8
HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY EVERYONE!
- NEW PLAYABLE CHARACTER: Pac-Mom
 Now she’s chomping on dots and frightened ghosts, just like her son!
- NEW GAME STYLE: Atari
 Gameplay is roughly the same as the original Atari 2600 Pac-Man, but now in an arcade environment.

- All sprites now use a universal 8-frame system rather than using 5 separate frame systems. This means that there may be minor differences in the animations that just make them a bit better and require four less forever loops.

- A maze editor is also available for anyone who wants to make their own mazes. You can find the link in the project description.

- Bugfixes

Unnoted: The frame systems were separate for:
Pac-Man
Ghosts
Frightened Time-out
Miru
Power Pellet and 1UP text flashing.

v1.7.1
- Patches for various issues, including the fruit sound not being played in the Fruit Chase gamemode.

v1.7
- Visual changes to the menu.
- Added 3 new options.
- Game Speed now allows you to set the game’s speed to slow, medium or fast.
For those who want the original “Fast” gamemode back, you can now use this option and can also play Fruit Chase with this setting too!
- Starting lives can now be set to 1, 2, 3 or 5
- The Bonus Life Threshold can now be set to 10000, 15000, 20000, 30000 or turned off.
- Fixed a secret level editor I had to make my mazes! (Pssst, press P to access)

Fixed many bugs, particularly related to exiting to the menu after Game over.

V1.6
- Ms Pac’s Quadrants now changes to the other 4 mazes instead of being stuck in the first maze.
- The Fast Gamemode now only speeds up Pac-Man, everything else is the same speed.
- After a Game Over, the game now returns to the menu instead of needing to click the green flag again.
- Added the following Cheat Codes:
Racktest: Instantly completes the level.
Rackwarp: Completes the current level and warps to a specific level.
Game Over: Instantly defeats the player.
Erased: Instant Game Over

- Major bugs that have appeared in 1.5.3 have been fixed.

v1.5.3
- Added back Debug Mode!
- Completely changed how the maze renders, giving a massive performance boost that now allows the game to run at 30 FPS in the Vanilla Scratch Engine.
- Purged everything related to Multiplayer Pac-Man as it is now in a separate project. (Multiplayer Dump)
- Added an FPS counter for debugging purposes.
- Fixed the Lives not showing up
- Fixed a bug in the menu
- Changed the victory screen

v1.5.2
- Added a watermark so future remixes won't be able to get away as the original creator so easily.
- Added sounds in the menu.
- Atari Pac now has a different sound for eating fruit.
- Reworked how lives, fruit and score are drawn again. Nothing changes gameplay-wise but should improve performance.
- Other optimisations and Bugfixes have been made.

v1.5.1
Changed Fruit Score behaviour in Ms. Pac-Man and Jr. Pac-Man.

v1.5
- NEW MAZE: Ms. Pac's Quadrants!
- Right now it's only the first maze, but the other 3 mazes may be added in the future.
- The Dots and Power Pellets have now been coloured an ugly blue on Atari Alleyways and a fitting white on Watcher's Way.
- Fixed Ghosts phasing through walls upon reaching an exit.
- Fruit should now appear in the Ms Pac and Jr Pac Game Styles.

NOTE: The dots having a third colour has lead to massive performance issues. I will try to fix them next update, but for now, I recommend that you use Turbowarp.

v1.4.1
When multiple frightened ghosts are clustered towards each other when they get eaten by Pac-Man, things tend to get buggy. That should hopefully be fixed.

v1.4
- The menu has been completely redesigned and can now be navigated using WASD, the Arrow Keys or the mouse.
- All Mazes have been renamed.
- The "Original" gamemode has been renamed to Classic.
- The "Extras" button has been renamed to Options.
- The Lives and Level Counters positions have been shifted to their more accurate positions.
- In Fruit Chase mode, Blinky and Miru's starting positions are accurate to the original Pac N Pal.
- Reworked all target tiles to use only one sprite.
- Pac-Man can be optionally controlled using the Arrow Keys.
- The Cruise Elroy Indicator is now OFF by default.
- Adjusted the Target Tile positions in Scatter mode.
- Adjusted how Ghosts travel to their target tiles.

v1.3
- After such a long time of trying to figure it out, I FINALLY patched out the bug where after you die, Blinky would be the only ghost to appear.
- The entire top HUD has been rearranged to have more accurate positions and has been reworked to use stamps rather than clones, increasing performance, but losing quality.
- The player no longer moves a full tile before exiting via a gate.
- Decreased the Max High Score from 3,333,360 to 999,999.

v1.2.3
Ghost movements have been optimised.

v1.2.2
- Reworked Passageways to fix the Atari 2600 map for now. Will improve in the future.
- The Fruit that spawns below the Ghost House now correctly reflects the Game Style. Score is not changed however.
- Fixed the game starting with only 1 life. That was a playtesting mistake.

v1.2.1
- The passage in the bottom of the small maze has split into two.
- Removed the dots surrounding the Ghost House in the Atari 2600 map.
- Using the Jr. Pac-Man Game Style will now change the game font.

v1.2
- Added Game Styles for Ms Pac-Man and Jr Pac-Man. For now, they just change the sounds and bottom fruit, nothing changes with the fruit ingame.
- The Life counter now reflects which character is being played. (Atari Pac has green squares from the original game.)
- A downside to this is that they no longer render in full resolution without Turbowarp's high quality pen feature.

- Removed Debug mode, might re-add later.
- Reworked some parts of the game.

v1.1.1
- Changed Atari Pac's colour palette to match the original game. The original design looked like Photoshop.
